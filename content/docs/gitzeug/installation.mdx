At the current state of this project, I feel like it is not worthy to be included in package managers, so you will have to build the binaries yourself. Unless you use NixOS [with flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/nixos-with-flakes-enabled).

### NixOS
1. Add this GitHub repository to the inputs of your flake.nix:
   ```nix
   gitzeug.url = "github:thaemisch/gitzeug";
   ```
2. Add the package to your configuration.nix:
   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      ...
      inputs.gitzeug.packages.${pkgs.system}.gitzeug
   ];
   ```

### Binaries
1. Ensure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thaemisch/gitzeug.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd gitzeug
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```
5. Add the binary to your PATH for easy access:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release
   ```
